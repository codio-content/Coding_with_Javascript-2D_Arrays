Imagine a classroom with rows of desks, and at each desk sits a student. Think of the 2D array as a grid, with rows going left to right and columns going up and down. Each element in the array can be referenced by specifying the row and column we wish to select. 

The first element in the desks array, `desks[0]` contains an array with four elements, `[‘Adam’, ‘Ben’, ‘Carl’, ‘David’]`.

| | C0 | C1 | C2 | C3
|-|-|-|-|-|
|R0| 'Adam' | 'Ben' | 'Carl' | 'David' |
|R1| 'Edward' |'Frank' | 'Georgia' | 'Helen' |
|R2| 'Isabelle' | 'Joan' | 'Kelly' | 'Linda' |
