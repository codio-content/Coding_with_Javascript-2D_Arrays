So far, you have learned to use simple one-dimensional arrays:

```javascript
numArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
strArray = ['Alice', 'Tariq', 'Bob']
```

In this unit, you are going to learn about two-dimensional arrays.

Arrays with two or more dimensions can be very useful. Two-dimensional arrays are the most common, so we are going to concentrate on these in this unit. However, it is worth knowing for future reference that more dimensions are possible.
